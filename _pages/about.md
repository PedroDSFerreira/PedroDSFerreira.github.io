Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pedro Ferreira, a Master's student in Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro. I'm passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I enjoy diving into topics like algorithms, data structures, OOP, design patterns, microservices architecture, infrastructure management, and CI/CD.

Outside of my studies, I love playing guitar, exploring new music, and working on side projects that help me grow as a developer.
