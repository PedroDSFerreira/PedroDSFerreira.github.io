Hi 👋 I'm Pedro Ferreira, a Software Engineer at Nokia, and a Master's student in Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro.

I enjoy working on everything from algorithms and data structures to software architecture and CI/CD. I like approaching problems with a practical mindset and building solutions that are efficient, reliable, and easy to maintain.

Outside of work and university, I play guitar, explore new music, and watch series and movies. I also spend (probably too much) time tweaking my dotfiles and development setup, testing new project ideas, and managing my homelab’s infrastructure, automating whatever I can along the way.
